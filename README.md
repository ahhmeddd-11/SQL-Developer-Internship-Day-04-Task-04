# Task - 04 - Aggregate Queries (GROUP BY, SUM, COUNT, AVG)

## Overview
This task focuses on writing and executing **aggregate queries** in MySQL.  
It demonstrates how to summarize data using aggregate functions, group records, and filter grouped results.

## Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench  

## Objectives
- Use aggregate functions:
  - `SUM()` – add values  
  - `COUNT()` – count rows/records  
  - `AVG()` – calculate averages  
- Group rows using `GROUP BY`  
- Combine grouping with sorting using `ORDER BY`  
- Practice writing clear and simple SQL queries for analysis  

## Deliverables
- `task-4-query.sql` (SQL script of queries)  
- `task-4-queries.txt` (queries in text format)  
- Screenshots of query results (SUM, COUNT, AVG, GROUP BY)  
- Documentation in `README.md`
